# ClimaScape: Adaptive Green Infrastructure Planner - DevHack 2025 (Round 1 - Ideation)

This repository serves as the official submission point for our team, [tech titans], for the DevHack 2025 Ideation Round.

## Project Overview
ClimaScape is an innovative web application designed to combat the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect by providing city planners with data-driven insights and tools for optimal green infrastructure planning and community engagement.

## Round 1 Submission Details
As Round 1 is focused on **ideation and concept presentation**, this repository currently hosts:
* Our comprehensive **Presentation (PPT)** outlining the problem, solution, technical approach, UI/UX mockups, and business model.
* **UI/UX Mockup Images:** High-fidelity designs visualizing our proposed web application.

*Note:* A functional codebase will be developed in Round 2 should our team be shortlisted, aligning with the hackathon's multi-stage format. This repository will then evolve to host our working prototype.

Thank you for reviewing our submission.
